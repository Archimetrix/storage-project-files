Vivimusic Web is a browser extension that reskins **[music.youtube.com](https://music.youtube.com)** with animated Canvas-style backgrounds (like Apple Music/Spotify Canvas), word-synced lyrics, an audio equalizer, Sponsorblock skipping, Last.fm scrobbling, and a dark, glassy theme — without needing a separate desktop app or a Chrome Web Store install.

This extension is **not published on the Chrome Web Store**. It's distributed as source from this repository and loaded manually as an "unpacked" extension. Follow the installation guide below — it takes about a minute.


**🔴This extension require good amount of ram and some graphics  for example if you have a littlebit gpu even windows intregated gpu thats also can run this just make sure that graphics acceleration is turn on in your browser its very important .its actively themeing live website so system resource is essential-think of it like you running a software basically**

## Features

- 🎨 **Canvas Artwork** — Fetches animated, Apple Music–style Canvas videos (or high-res artwork as a fallback) for the currently playing song and blends it into the player thumbnail and page background.
- 🖼️ **Spotify Canvas** — Spotify Canvas support for YT Music songs. Connect with a one-click Spotify login or by supplying your `sp_dc` cookie locally.
- 🔄 **Spotify → YouTube Music Playlist Transfer** — Transfer your Spotify playlists directly from the browser into YouTube Music without sending your library to a VIVIMUSIC server. Select one or multiple Spotify playlists, match each track against YouTube Music, create private destination playlists, and add the matched videos while preserving playlist order.
- 🌊 **Kawarp Background Engine** — The animated Canvas background is fully tunable from the popup: opacity, warp intensity, blur passes, saturation, dithering, animation speed, and transition duration all have live sliders, plus a "pause when inactive" toggle and a one-click **Reset to defaults** button. There's also an "artwork/image-only" mode if you'd rather skip the warped background animation entirely and just show static art.
- 🎚️ **Built-in Equalizer** — A toggleable audio equalizer for YouTube Music playback.
- 🎤 **Synced Lyrics** — Word-synced lyrics when available, falling back to line-synced, then plain lyrics. Pulled from multiple providers so you almost always get *something*.
- 🔀 **Multiple Lyrics Providers** — Toggle individual sources on or off:
  - BetterLyrics (word-sync / TTML)
  - BetterLyrics (Kugou)
  - BetterLyrics (Legacy)
  - LRCLIB
  - Spotify
  - Musixmatch
  - Unison
  - BiniLyrics
- 📑 **Auto-open Lyrics Tab** — Optionally jumps straight to the Lyrics tab when a track starts.
- 🎬 **Lyrics on Video Tracks** — Toggle whether the synced lyrics panel also shows up for tracks played as music videos, not just audio-only songs.
- 🥇 **Lyrics Provider Priority** — Reorder and prioritize which lyrics provider is tried first, with an optional "wait for priority source" toggle before falling back to others.
- 🎶 **Lyrics Offset** — Adjust the lyrics timeline sync per-track (saved locally).
- 💃 **REZE Dance** — An animated dancer plays when no lyrics can be found for a track, toggleable in the popup.
- ⏭️ **Sponsorblock** — Automatically skips non-music segments (intros, sponsor spots, etc.) using Sponsorblock data.
- 🎧 **Last.fm Scrobbling** — Logs in with your Last.fm username and password and scrobbles what you listen to, sends Now Playing status, and can sync Likes/Unlikes as Loves/Unloves on Last.fm.
- 💾 **Local Artwork Cache** — Previously fetched artwork/Canvas videos are cached locally so repeat plays load instantly. Viewable and clearable from the popup.
- 🦁 **Brave Browser Fix Guide** — A built-in walkthrough for resolving Spotify login quirks specific to Brave's shields/cookie handling.
- 🎨 **THEME** — A full dark, glassy visual reskin of YouTube Music, toggleable independently of Canvas and Lyrics.
- 🔔 **Update Checker** — Since this isn't on the Web Store, the popup can check this GitHub repo's [Releases](../../releases) page and let you know when a newer version is out. It does not auto-install updates.

## Installation Guide

> Because this extension isn't listed on any extension store, your browser will warn you that it's an "unpacked" / "developer mode" extension. That's expected and normal — it just means you installed it from source instead of a store.

### Chrome / Brave / Vivaldi / Opera

1. **Download The Zipfile From Releases**
2. **Extract it** to a folder you won't move or delete later (e.g. `Documents/Vivimusic Web`). Chrome loads the extension directly from this folder, so if you delete it, the extension breaks.
3. Open your browser and go to:
   ```
   chrome://extensions
   ```
   (For Brave: `brave://extensions` · For Vivaldi: `vivaldi://extensions` · For Opera: `opera://extensions`)
4. Turn on **Developer mode** — the toggle is in the top-right corner of the extensions page.
5. Click **Load unpacked**.
6. Select the folder you extracted and open the folder you will see icon and src folder when you see these two folders dont click on them just click open to select (the one that directly contains `manifest.json`).
7. Vivimusic Web should now appear in your extensions list and in your toolbar. Open **[music.youtube.com](https://music.youtube.com)**, play a song, and you should see the new theme and Canvas artwork kick in within a second or two.

### Firefox

Currently only chromium browsers are supported .. it will not work on firefox .

## Updating

3. Extract it and again load unpack it then it will be updated .
That's it — no need to remove and re-add the extension.

## Spotify Canvas Login

To get Spotify Canvas videos on YouTube Music tracks, connect a Spotify account from the popup in one of two ways:

1. **Connect Spotify** — click the button and log in normally.
2. **Paste `sp_dc` cookie** — if the one-click login doesn't work for your browser (this is common on **Brave**, due to its cookie/shield handling), paste your Spotify `sp_dc` cookie value into the field and click **Save sp_dc locally**. It's stored locally in your browser only.

If you're on Brave and hitting login issues, click the **"Using Brave Browser?"** info button in the popup for a step-by-step fix guide built into the extension.

Once connected, you'll see your connected account shown in the popup with a **Disconnect Spotify** option to revoke access at any time.

## Spotify → YouTube Music Playlist Transfer

Vivimusic Web can transfer normal Spotify playlists into YouTube Music directly from your browser. The transfer runs client-side: playlist metadata and track information are processed by the extension in your browser, and the extension talks directly to Spotify and YouTube Music using the sessions you already have open.

### What it supports

- Select one or multiple Spotify playlists.
- Read the songs in each selected playlist.
- Search YouTube Music for each Spotify track using title and artist information.
- Create a matching **private** YouTube Music playlist for each Spotify playlist.
- Add matched YouTube Music videos in the same order as the Spotify playlist.
- Continue through a playlist when an individual track cannot be matched, and show progress in the transfer log.

### What it does not require

This feature does **not** require a Spotify Developer account, Spotify Client ID/secret, Google Cloud project, OAuth app registration, VIVIMUSIC server, Render deployment, database, or separate transfer application. It uses the user's existing logged-in browser sessions.

### Authentication model

**Spotify:** Open Spotify and sign in normally. Vivimusic reads the existing Spotify Web Player `sp_dc` session cookie and uses Spotify's own Web Player session flow to obtain the session needed to read playlists. The extension never asks for or stores your Spotify password.

**YouTube Music:** Open [music.youtube.com](https://music.youtube.com) and sign in normally. The transfer uses the logged-in YouTube Music page and its own browser session/configuration to search, create, and update playlists. The extension never asks for or stores your Google password.

### Important implementation note

The transfer feature uses internal web interfaces exposed by Spotify and YouTube Music rather than their public developer APIs. This is why no developer application credentials are required, but those internal interfaces are not stable public APIs and can change without notice. A future Spotify or Google web-client change may require an extension update.

### Privacy model

There is no VIVIMUSIC transfer server in the data path:

```text
Spotify session
      ↓
Vivimusic Web extension (your browser)
      ↓
YouTube Music session
      ↓
Private YouTube Music playlists
```

The extension does not upload your Spotify library to a VIVIMUSIC backend. Spotify and YouTube Music still receive the requests required for the transfer because they are the services being read from and written to.

### Transfer safety

Keep the transfer page open until the operation finishes. Do not close the YouTube Music tab, switch apps, or intentionally interrupt the browser while matching and playlist updates are running. The current implementation uses a page bridge inside the logged-in YouTube Music tab, so keeping that environment intact reduces the chance of an interrupted transfer.

### Current limitation: Spotify Liked Songs

Spotify **Liked Songs** are intentionally excluded from the transfer UI. Normal Spotify playlists are supported and have been tested with the current implementation, while the Liked Songs collection is exposed differently by Spotify's internal web data model. Rather than create an unreliable or misleading transfer option, Vivimusic currently focuses on standard Spotify playlists.

---

## Last.fm Scrobbling

Vivimusic Web can scrobble what you listen to on YouTube Music straight to your Last.fm profile.

**Logging in:**
1. Open the popup and switch on **Last.fm scrobbling**.
2. Enter your Last.fm **username** and **password** and click **Connect Last.fm account**.
3. Your password is sent once, directly to Last.fm's own API, and is never stored — only the session token Last.fm returns is saved locally, and it can be revoked any time from your Last.fm account's **Applications** settings without changing your password.

**How scrobble timing works:**
A track is scrobbled once it has played past *whichever comes first*:
- the configured **percentage** of its total duration, or
- the configured **number of minutes**,

as long as the track is longer than the configured **minimum song length**. These three thresholds are all adjustable in the popup.

**Likes/Unlikes:**
When enabled, liking or unliking a song in YouTube Music sends a matching Love/Unlove to Last.fm.

---

## Permissions & Privacy

Vivimusic Web only requests what it needs to function, and only runs on `music.youtube.com`:

| Permission | Why it's needed |
|---|---|
| `storage`, `unlimitedStorage` | Saves your settings and caches artwork locally, in your browser only. |
| `activeTab`, `tabs` | Detects the current track and communicates between the popup and the YouTube Music tab. |
| `alarms` | Schedules the twice-daily background check for new releases on GitHub. |
| `cookies` | Used only for Spotify Canvas login (reading/managing the `sp_dc` session cookie needed to fetch Canvas videos on your behalf). |
| Host access to `music.youtube.com` | Where the extension actually runs and injects its UI. |
| Host access to `artwork.boidu.dev`, `lyrics-api.boidu.dev`, `lrclib.net`, `apic-desktop.musixmatch.com` | Third-party lyrics and artwork APIs used to fetch Canvas artwork and synced lyrics for the currently playing song. |
| Host access to `open.spotify.com`, `api.spotify.com`, `api-partner.spotify.com`, `spclient.wg.spotify.com`, `apresolve.spotify.com`, `clienttoken.spotify.com`, `canvaz.scdn.co` | Spotify's own endpoints, used for Spotify Canvas and for the Spotify → YouTube Music playlist transfer. The transfer reads normal Spotify playlist data from Spotify's logged-in Web Player session. |
| Host access to `sponsor.ajay.app` | Sponsorblock's API — used only if Sponsorblock is enabled, to fetch skip segments for the currently playing video. |
| Host access to `song.link`, `code.thetadev.de` | Used by other Vivimusic track-resolution features. The Spotify → YouTube Music transfer itself performs its matching against YouTube Music directly. |
| Host access to `api.github.com`, `github.com` | Used solely to check the latest release tag for the update notice — no data is sent, it's a simple read-only GET request. |
| Host access to `ws.audioscrobbler.com` | Last.fm's API — used only if you enable and log in to Last.fm scrobbling. Sends the current artist/track (and your login once, to establish a session) directly to Last.fm; nothing is sent anywhere else. |

Nothing is sent to a VIVIMUSIC-owned server. The extension communicates directly with the external services needed by the enabled features: Spotify, YouTube Music, artwork/lyrics providers, GitHub for the release check, Sponsorblock if enabled, and Last.fm if you opt in to scrobbling. For the Spotify → YouTube Music transfer, Spotify playlist data is read locally by the extension and YouTube Music receives the search/playlist-update requests needed to perform the transfer. No analytics, no tracking, no third-party accounts beyond Spotify and Last.fm themselves if you choose to connect them.

## Troubleshooting

**Nothing changed after installing.**
Make sure you're on `music.youtube.com` (not `youtube.com/music` or the mobile site), and refresh the tab after loading the extension for the first time.

**"Manifest file is missing or unreadable" when loading unpacked.**
You selected the wrong folder — make sure you pick the folder that directly contains `manifest.json`, not its parent folder or the `src` subfolder.

**Extension disappeared / shows an error icon after a browser restart.**
The folder you extracted the extension to was moved, renamed, or deleted. Re-extract it somewhere permanent and reload it via `chrome://extensions`.

**Spotify → YouTube Music says Spotify is not connected.**
Open Spotify and make sure you are fully signed in. Then return to the transfer page and click **Refresh**. Vivimusic uses the existing Spotify Web Player session rather than a separate Spotify developer login.

**Spotify playlists appear, but a transfer stops or the YouTube Music bridge times out.**
Keep the transfer page open and make sure a YouTube Music tab is also open and signed in. Do not close the YT Music tab or interrupt the browser while the transfer is running. Reload `music.youtube.com` and retry if the page was left idle for a long time.

**A Spotify playlist cannot be transferred because some songs are missing.**
The matcher searches YouTube Music and selects the best candidate from the returned results. Ambiguous, region-specific, live, remix, cover, or otherwise unavailable tracks may not match correctly. The transfer continues with the remaining tracks and reports the final results.

**Lyrics aren't showing for a song.**
Not every song has synced lyrics available from any provider. Try toggling different providers on/off in the popup — coverage varies per source.

**Last.fm login fails.**
Double-check your username and password (not your email, unless that's what you normally log in with). If it still fails, your Last.fm account may have two-factor or app-specific restrictions — try generating the connection again after a few minutes.

**Scrobbles aren't showing up on Last.fm.**
Check that **Last.fm scrobbling** is switched on and you're shown as connected in the popup. Remember scrobbles only send after your configured percentage/minutes threshold is reached, not the instant a song starts (that's what "Now Playing" is for).

**Song/Video toggle button doesn't appear, or is in the wrong spot.**
YouTube Music's layout changes occasionally, which can shift where this button gets injected. Open an issue with a screenshot of the player bar.

**Something looks visually broken after a YouTube Music redesign.**
YouTube Music's own layout changes occasionally, which can break selectors this extension relies on. Open an issue on this repository with a screenshot and the URL/page you were on.
